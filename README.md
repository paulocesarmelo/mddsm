## Resolving dependencies

Run `mvn clean package`. You need to have [Eclipse Modeling](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2019-03/r/eclipse-modeling-tools) or its newer version installed in `/opt/` dir.

Case you intend to build in a CI server, you can use the docker image in build folder.
